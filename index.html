            <p>Our server offers a unique mostly vanilla experience a friendly community.</p>

        <section id="rules">
            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <p>Please follow these rules to ensure a friendly and fair environment for all players:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No griefing or stealing.</li>
                <li>Respect other players and staff.</li>
                <li>No cheating or exploiting bugs.</li>
                <li>Keep the chat clean and respectful.</li>
                <li>Follow any additional server-specific rules.</li>

                <li>Don't be a jerk. This is a welcoming space where everyone should feel comfortable to be themselves
                    and any action that makes anyone feel like they can't, will not be tolerated.</li>
                <li>If you aren't sure ask, somebody will be here to help you out.</li>
                <li>No griefing other players. This means no stealing, no blowing up another persons space and no PvP
                    without agreement. If somebody says no, it means just that.</li>
                <li>If you can see a build close to where you want to build something (a home, a farm or even just a
                    pile of rocks), ask the person it belongs to if that is ok. You can never be sure how far a player
                    might wants to expand to. If you don't know who it belongs to post a picture in the "who on earth
                    built this" channel and we'll try and track them down.</li>
                <li>When you claim a spot, put up some signs. This makes dealing with claims easier.</li>
                <li>If you are going to open a shop or use the shopping district, please follow the <a
                        href="#shopping">Shopping District</a> rules</li>
                <li>Have fun</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We are pretty new to this and this list will change, with everyone being alerted when this happens.</p>
            <p>Above all we want this to be safe and fun.</p>
        </section>


        <section id="shopping">
            <h2>Shopping District Rules</h2>
            <p>If you plan to be a shop owner, we have a few rules to help encourage a healthy shopping district:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Shops that are not stocked (this will be reported on by players) or not built within 3 weeks of the
                    shopping district opening will be subject to "competition"</li>
                <li>Shops that are not stocked/abandoned will also be subject to "competition"</li>
                <li>Mods always poke a player to find out why you have not stocked and excuses will be excepted (we are
                    all only human and this is a game after all)</li>
                <li>Competition means - A duplicate permit will be created and placed on the competition board. First to
                    grab it, get's the permit. Please don't grab them all.</li>
                <li>There's a designated area for the SD and it's pretty massive so builds can be 30x30 maximum</li>
                <li>Entities will be allowed in shops this season, this includes beacons, mobs, item frames, mine carts.
                    Just don't go to crazy please.</li>
                <li>Remember so many of you asked for this, so it's your fault :) </li>

                <li>No chastising players for ANYTHING at ANY TIME. If a player does something they shouldn't be doing,
                    message the mod channel and we will discuss it here. NO RAISED VOICES.</li>
